# Code Structure Summary

## Recent updates (2026-01-23)

- **Help & Support**: New `HelpSupportScreen.js` with production-safe email and fallback modal (copy-to-clipboard).
- **Calendar events**: Visibility control (`all` / `none` / `selected`), migration 019, refresh on focus.
- **Super admin**: Manual attendance and employee lists show all active employees (no role filter).
- **Password management**: Forgot/Reset password with deep linking (`hadirai://reset-password`); change password in Theme Settings.
- **Auth service**: Email change endpoint added for future use.

## What Changed

The codebase has been restructured from a flat organization to a **modular, feature-based architecture**. This ensures:

1. **Feature Isolation**: Each feature (auth, attendance, tickets, etc.) is self-contained
2. **Clear Dependencies**: Features don't interfere with each other
3. **Deployment Ready**: Clear structure for CI/CD and deployment
4. **Maintainability**: Easy to find and modify code

## Key Benefits

### 1. Feature Isolation
- Each feature has its own directory
- Features can be developed independently
- Changes to one feature don't affect others

### 2. Clear Dependencies
- Features import from `shared/` and `core/`
- Features communicate through well-defined APIs
- No circular dependencies

### 3. Deployment Ready
- `.github/workflows/` for CI/CD
- Clear build structure
- Environment configuration

### 4. Maintainability
- Easy to find code (by feature)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Better code organization

## Migration Status

### ✅ Completed
- **Core Infrastructure**: Fully implemented
  - ✅ `core/config/` - Supabase configuration
  - ✅ `core/contexts/` - Auth and Theme contexts
  - ✅ `core/navigation/` - App, Auth, and Main navigators (includes deep linking support)
  - ✅ `core/services/` - Storage abstraction layer
- **Shared Modules**: Fully implemented
  - ✅ `shared/constants/` - Roles, work modes, routes (includes `FORGOT_PASSWORD`, `RESET_PASSWORD`)
  - ✅ `shared/components/` - Logo, Trademark, CustomDrawer
  - ✅ `shared/utils/` - Responsive utilities
- **Partial Feature Migration**:
  - ✅ `features/auth/` - Auth service and utilities (screens still in `screens/`)
  - ✅ `features/calendar/` - Calendar component (screen still in `screens/`)
- **New Features Added**:
  - ✅ Password change utility (`utils/passwordChange.js`)
  - ✅ Forgot password screen (`screens/ForgotPasswordScreen.js`)
  - ✅ Reset password screen (`screens/ResetPasswordScreen.js`)
  - ✅ Help & Support screen (`screens/HelpSupportScreen.js`) with production-safe email
  - ✅ Calendar events Supabase integration (visibility: all/none/selected)
  - ✅ Super admin manual attendance: all active employees visible (see `utils/employees.js`)

### 🔄 In Progress
- **Feature Modules**: Most features still need migration
  - ⏳ Attendance feature (screens: EmployeeDashboard, AttendanceHistory, ManualAttendanceScreen)
  - ⏳ Tickets feature (screens: TicketScreen, TicketManagementScreen)
  - ⏳ Leave feature (screens: LeaveRequestScreen)
  - ⏳ Employees feature (screens: EmployeeManagement, CreateUserScreen, SignupApprovalScreen)
  - ⏳ Notifications feature (screens: NotificationsScreen)
  - ⏳ Analytics feature (screens: AdminDashboard, HRDashboard)
- **Import Path Updates**: Navigation and screens still use legacy paths

### ⏳ Pending
- Complete all feature migrations (move screens and utils to feature modules)
- Create feature `index.js` files for all features
- Update all imports to use feature modules instead of legacy paths
- Remove legacy code from `screens/`, `utils/`, `components/` after migration
- Update `App.js` to use feature modules instead of `utils/employees`
- Migrate password change utility to `features/auth/utils/`
- Migrate calendar utils to `features/calendar/utils/`

## How to Use

### Importing from Features (New Structure)

```javascript
// Auth feature (migrated)
import { authenticateUser, createUser } from '../features/auth';

// Shared constants
import { ROLES } from '../shared/constants/roles';
import { WORK_MODES } from '../shared/constants/workModes';
import { ROUTES } from '../shared/constants/routes';

// Core contexts
import { useAuth } from '../core/contexts/AuthContext';
import { useTheme } from '../core/contexts/ThemeContext';

// Shared components
import Logo from '../shared/components/Logo';
import CustomDrawer from '../shared/components/CustomDrawer';
```

### Current Import Patterns (Legacy - Still in Use)

```javascript
// Legacy screens (currently used by navigation)
import EmployeeDashboard from '../screens/EmployeeDashboard';
import AttendanceHistory from '../screens/AttendanceHistory';
import ForgotPasswordScreen from '../screens/ForgotPasswordScreen';
import ResetPasswordScreen from '../screens/ResetPasswordScreen';

// Legacy utils (currently used by screens)
import { checkIn, checkOut } from '../utils/auth';
import { changePassword } from '../utils/passwordChange';
import { getEmployees } from '../utils/employees';
import { createTicket } from '../utils/ticketManagement';
import { createCalendarEvent, getCalendarEvents } from '../utils/calendar';
```

### Adding a New Feature

1. Create feature directory: `features/[feature-name]/`
2. Add subdirectories: `screens/`, `services/`, `utils/`, etc.
3. Create `index.js` for public API
4. Export from feature's `index.js`
5. Import in other modules via feature's `index.js`

## Next Steps

1. Continue migrating features to modular structure
2. Update all imports to use new paths
3. Remove legacy code after migration
4. Add tests for each feature module

## CI/CD & Deployment

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated build and deployment workflow
- **Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic dependency installation with validation
  - Package-lock.json corruption detection and recovery
  - Multi-platform builds (Android & iOS)
  - Environment variable support
